# -aesar-cipher-encryption-decryption-attack-
This project implements the Caesar cipher, a simple substitution cipher technique that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. It provides functionality for encrypting and decrypting messages using a user-specified key, as well as performing an attack to automatically decipher the encrypted text without knowing the key.

Features:

Encryption: The program allows users to encrypt plaintext messages by specifying a key (the number of positions to shift the letters). The encryption process shifts each letter in the plaintext by the specified key to generate the ciphertext.

Decryption: Users can also decrypt ciphertext messages by entering the key that was used for encryption. The decryption process reverses the encryption operation and retrieves the original plaintext.

Attack: The program includes an attack mode that automatically performs a brute-force search to find the key used for encryption. It tries all possible keys and displays the decrypted text for each key. The user can manually analyze the results to identify the correct key.

Input from Console or File: The program supports input from both the console and text files. Users can enter the text to be encrypted/decrypted directly through the console or provide the path to a text file containing the data.

Output to Console or File: The program provides options to display the results (encrypted/decrypted text) on the console or save them to a text file. Users can choose their preferred output method.

User-Friendly Interface: The program guides users with clear instructions and prompts, making it easy to interact with and utilize the encryption, decryption, and attack functionalities.
