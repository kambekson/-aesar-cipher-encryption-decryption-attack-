# -aesar-cipher-encryption-decryption-attack-
This project implements the Caesar cipher, a simple substitution cipher technique that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. It provides functionality for encrypting and decrypting messages using a user-specified key, as well as performing an attack to automatically decipher the encrypted text without knowing the key.
